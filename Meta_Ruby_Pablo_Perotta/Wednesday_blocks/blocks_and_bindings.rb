When you create the block, you capture the local bindings, such as x . Then
you pass the block to a method that has its own separate set of bindings. In
the previous example, those bindings also include a variable named x . Still,
the code in the block sees the x that was around when the block was defined,
not the methodâ€™s x , which is not visible at all in the block.
